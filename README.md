"TODO-list" 

Site for managing the performance of personal tasks. 

The TODO List is actually a notebook in which a person sets tasks
and records their implementation. 

Tasks are automatically sorted by their due dates, 
taking into account the completion marker Button 
Complete if a task is not done and Undo if a task is done, 
this button changes the status of the task to the opposite and redirects to home page.
