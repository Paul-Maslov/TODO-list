"# TODO-list" 

Site for managing the performance of personal tasks.
The TODO List is actually a notebook in which a person sets tasks and records their implementation.
Tasks are automatically sorted by their due dates, taking into account the completion marker
Button Complete if a task is not done and Undo if a task is done, this button changes the status
of the task to the opposite and redirects to home page.
